      <h1>Turning Parks into Classrooms, and Children into Leaders</h1>
      <p class="lead">An initiative teaching 150+ children with the support of 23 mentors and 300+ community members since 2022.</p>
      <p>Bright Futures began in 2022 when local students and teachers decided to bring learning out from closed rooms and into the community. We run weekend classes in parks for students from Grades 1–10 in English, Hindi, Mathematics, Science, Computer Science & AI, and Social Studies. Our program focuses on consistent engagement, mentorship, and low-cost sustainability so that learning continues year after year.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to remove barriers to education by creating open, welcoming learning spaces where curiosity thrives. We train volunteers in child-centered pedagogy, work closely with parents, and create simple resource kits that make teaching scalable and reliable. Bright Futures is not only about improving marks — it is about nurturing confidence, critical thinking, and the belief that every child can succeed.</p>
